### Desciption
YoungTravels is an agency that provides a platform for the young adults and teens who want to go on trips with friends but have a limited budget. It's the student edition of travel packages.

*Our motto* - **By the teens, Of the teens, For the teens.** 

### About the Website
    **Some features**
    The form at the bottom actually works! Yes, it sends the data collected to a google spreadsheet. 
    As for the CSS, we have some very cool CSS code embedded in the website, from the buzzing search button to the cards that rotate and zoom. 
    The search bar works right now but only as a seach query to google. The reason to make this was that later on we will collaborate with travel websites such as MakeMyTrip,       and the search bar will actually take the users to their website with the particuloar search query.
    
### Business Plan

   The main idea of building a website like this was to direct the travel sector to a certain group of people,
   a group that has been left ignored and unattended in this sector - teenagers and young adults.
   
   When it comes to travel, most websites provide travel pakages for either families or couples or certain events. There are extremely limited ones who actually provide a travel 
   package for the young teens and adults going to party and attend concerts and music festivals.
   Furthermore, those who do provide packages make them either way too expensive or unsafe and unreliable.
   
   With that in mind, the purpose of creating YoungTravels, was to provide a solution to that problem. Creat a simplistic yet beautifully designed website that reaches out to 
   stressed teenagers and provides a blissful reprieve.
   
   YoungTravels is up to date with the most popular tourist destinations since us creators are teenagers ourselves. We strive to provide the best accomodation and the most          entertaining itenary for the cheapest possible price.
   
   #### Marketing Strategies
   
   We plan to gather data form fellow teenagers and young adults regarding their own preferences and their budget to form an accurate depiction of economic data.
   Since we have a young target audience, our main form of advertising will be through popular sites such as YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook.
   From here we will attract them to our website, where further details will be provided.
   We are confident that this strategy will be a success, since we know how teenage minds function.
   
   #### Future development
   
   As our company will grow, we plan to team up with major airlines and foreign local agencies to provide an even better experience for customers. It goes without saying that      our prospective tourist destinations will also rapidly increases.
